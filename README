How to initialize Tax Application and StringTools class with unit tests:

For Tax Application:

I've configured docker for this application, if you use it, then:
	- docker-compose build
	- docker-compose up
	At the same time, in another terminal tab:
	- ./init.sh
	Application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:9008/
	How to run phpunit tests: just run bin/phpunit

If you don't use a docker, you should configure apache server (I've used php 7.2) on public/ folder from root folder of project, then create two databases: first one is main database, second one just for testing purposes. Just update .env file DATABASE_URL parameter according to your mysql database connection and the just do the same for .env.test file.
Then:
	- composer install
	Schema migrations:
	- php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --env=dev
	- php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --env=test
	Load fixtures from different source to Database:
	- php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load --env=dev
	- php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load --env=test
	Run PHP Unit tests:
	- php bin/phpunit

For String Tools Class:
	- composer install
	- ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests
